## Game


### Main concept
Go from planet/base of some kind to others to smuggle new things (people, tools etc etc), and have to juggle inventory space.
Have to manage jumps carefully since they can be a little uncertain, and not to jump into blockades, pirates, bandits, the law etc.

Is able to jump when in combat, but have to wait for multiple things.Wait for FTL to fire up, then for computer to calculate the trajectory. Can jump without the computer but is much more dangerous and random, but should also be based on skill. Can manually adjust FTL path, and pause time to make easier for my boomer reactions.

Free flight - to be determined how it should work. My idea is kind of like Outer wilds but a little bit more fast-paced.

Combat - Probably few ways to fight back, should mainly dodge, weave and outsmart.

#### FTL: 
Fly ship that is affected by gravity.
The longer it goes, the less mass it gets. So faster and faster.

## World/lore or whatever

### What I know I want to include

- Spaceships
- (Almost) FTL
- Gene-engineering 
    - Almost all "aliens" are just modified humans (or have human origins)
- Retro futurism kind of(computers and stuff have Star Wars computer visual look)

### Maybe

- Feudalism (But instead of kings and lords it is companies that have basically the same role)
- Wild west (Large open areas without really anyhing, thankful for the space theme)
